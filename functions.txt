flatMap() 

const object = {
    firstKey: [
        {
            innerKey1: 'value1',
            innerKey2: [
                {
                    key1: 'val1', 
                    key2: 'val2'
                },
                {
                    key1: 'val3', 
                    key2: 'val4'
                },
                {
                    key1: 'val5', 
                    key2: 'val6'
                }
                
            ]

        }
    ]
}

before we get into flatMap() function, we can compare map() how it approaches an array element.
map function iterates over an array and can transform each elemect inside the array and it returns an array.Card
flatMap() function also does all the same work however after after applying a given callback function to each element of the array,
THEN it flattens the result by one level. 
It doesn't flattens the array by one level before applying a given callback function.

If the case that needs flatten by one lever before applying a given callback function,
